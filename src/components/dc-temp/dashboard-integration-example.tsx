/**
 * Integration Instructions:
 * 
 * 1. Add the following imports to dashboardpage.tsx:
 *    import TeamsIndexView from '../Views/TeamsIndexView'
 *    import { mockTeamSummary } from '../../DigitalColleagues/test-data'
 * 
 * 2. Add this case to the renderTabContent switch statement:
 *    case "teams":
 *      return <TeamsIndexView
 *        teams={mockTeamSummary}
 *        onCreateTeam={() => console.log('Create new team')}
 *        onTeamOpen={(team) => console.log('Open team:', team.name)}
 *        onTeamManage={(team) => console.log('Manage team:', team.name)}
 *      />
 * 
 * 3. The sidebar already includes a "Teams" item in mockSidebarItems.
 *    The navigation logic should handle setting activeTab to "teams" when clicked.
 * 
 * 4. Future enhancements:
 *    - Add team creation dialog
 *    - Add team detail view
 *    - Add team management functionality
 *    - Integrate with real data API
