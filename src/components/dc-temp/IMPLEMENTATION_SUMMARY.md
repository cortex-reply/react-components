4. **`TeamsIndexView.stories.tsx`** - Storybook stories for the main view

### Supporting Files
5. **`teams-complete-example.stories.tsx`** - Comprehensive example with documentation
6. **`team-card.test.tsx`** - Unit tests for the team card component
7. **`teams-index-view.test.tsx`** - Unit tests for the main view component
8. **`dashboard-integration-example.tsx`** - Integration guide for adding to dashboard
9. **`TEAMS_README.md`** - Complete documentation

## Data Structure Added

### New Types (added to `types.ts`)
```typescript
interface TeamSummary {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  humanColleagues: number
  digitalColleagues: number
  projects: number
}

interface TeamMember {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
  role: string

  members: TeamMember[]
  projects: Project[]
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
  isActive: boolean
}

interface TeamFormData {
  name: string
  description: string
  members: string[]
}
```

### Mock Data (added to `test-data.ts`)
- `mockTeamSummary`: Array of 6 sample teams with varied data

## Features Implemented

### TeamsIndexView Component

- **Icons**: Uses Lucide React icons for consistency
- **Typography**: Follows established text hierarchies

## Integration Ready

## Future Enhancements
- Team creation dialog/form
- Team detail view
- Team management functionality
- Real-time team updates
- Team member management
- Integration with actual API endpoints

## Testing
- Unit tests for both components
- Storybook stories for visual testing
- Type checking passes
- Build process successful

## Usage Example
```tsx
<TeamsIndexView
  teams={mockTeamSummary}
  onTeamOpen={(team) => navigate(`/teams/${team.id}`)}
  onCreateTeam={() => openCreateDialog()}
/>
```

The implementation successfully delivers a complete teams management interface that integrates seamlessly with the existing design system and architecture.
